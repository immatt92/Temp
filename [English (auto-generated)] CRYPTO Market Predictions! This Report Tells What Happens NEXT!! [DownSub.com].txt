if you're looking for an edge in the

crypto Market you need to follow the

whales and when it comes to whale

watching one of the companies that has

the most Insight is bitfinex not only is

the exchange absolutely swimming with

whales but it's also the sister company

of tether the most influential company

in crypto so when we saw that bitfinex

had published a report containing an

in-depth analysis of the crypto Market

we knew we had to find out what it said

today we're going to summarize this

report and tell you what it could mean

for

crypto the report we'll be summarizing

today is titled quote constrained

Bitcoin Supply and options pricing are

hinting at more volatility to come it's

one of many weekly bitfinex Alpha

reports that the exchange has published

but there's a reason why we picked this

one specifically that's because it was

published in the first week of October

the week before the crypto Market Market

dipped in other words the prediction

made in the title of the report seems to

have come true and a report called quote

Bitcoin flows to long-term holders as

volatility jumps was published the

following week we'll leave links to both

reports in the

description now this particular report

begins with a lengthy disclaimer which

states quote this newsletter contains

forward-looking statements statements

that relate to future events or future

performance

which are only projections opinions and

hypotheticals about possible future

events conditions outcomes and results

actual events or results May differ

materially quite funny considering what

I just

mentioned anyways the first part of the

report looks at what's been happening on

chain with Bitcoin the reports authors

found that the supply of BTC reserves on

exchanges hit its lowest level in over 5

years it's not clear whether this means

the total BTC on exchanges or just the

BTC held in cold wallets or cold storage

on that note if you're looking to get a

hardware wallet and want a huge discount

check out the deals page in the

description in any case the decline in

BTC on exchanges means two things first

it means that most BTC holders are

hodling I.E not selling though there was

a bit of selling during the crash in

early

2022 second it means that btc's price is

likely to be more volatile since there's

less Market depth on exchanges in plain

English less BTC on exchanges means it's

easier to push the price up or down

oddly enough the authors explain it as

quote a smaller pool of participants is

wielding a more significant sway over

bitcoin's price and they warn that this

means traditional crypto market analysis

may not work probably nothing any anyhow

the authors also examined another

indicator called coind days destroyed if

you watched our video about glass node

and Arc invests new way of analyzing

Bitcoin on chain you'll know all about

these exotic indicators and how they can

be made more accurate by adjusting how

they're measured as explained by the

authors of this report quote coin days

destroyed CDD is a crucial metric for

Bitcoin Supply analysis here's how it

works for any given movement of coins on

the blockchain multiply the number of

coins by the days since they last moved

the result is what you see here and I'll

note that the authors used a 30-day

moving average for this indicator as you

can hopefully see the number of coin

days destroyed spikes around BTC tops

and bottoms be they local or Market

cycle this basically tells you that the

Bitcoin whales are waking up note that

we'll leave a link to that indicator in

the Des description it's completely free

now the authors then zoom in on an

abnormal onchain finding and that's that

while short-term holders seem to be

holding medium-term holders seem to be

selling for context short-term is any

wallet that's held BTC for 6 to 12

months and medium-term is any wallet

that's held BTC for 12 to 18 months

logically the authors speculate that

medium-term holders are taking profits

now this is strange considering the

average price of BTC held over the

medium term is almost exactly what it is

now it's also strange that the authors

say this is normal behavior in early

bull markets regardless they then pivot

to comparing btc's price action to that

of the S&P 500 Index they estimate that

the S&P is close to finding its local

bottom they note that this is

significant because risk assets like BTC

tend to Rally as soon as stock market

indices like the SNP find their bottoms

there are just two problems with that

analysis the first is that BTC hasn't

been very correlated to the stock market

recently the second is that the exact

opposite seems to have happened last

week the s&p500 rallied from the local

bottom which bitfinex predicted but BTC

didn't Pump It dumped this ties into

another questionable analysis and that's

the so-called recber and up October

phenomena for reference BTC has

historically done poorly in September

but well in October hence the names the

thing is that this data is heavily

skewed by outlier months in Bull markets

and bare markets for example if you

remove the Octobers that occurred during

bull markets btc's returns for October

are sideways to down which is what we've

mostly seen so far at least at the time

of shooting but of course the authors

conclude that btc's price should should

go up in October like many of us have

maybe it still will who knows anywh who

to their credit the authors seem to have

the right idea when it comes to

analyzing Market sector rotations first

the market for US Government debt aka

the bond market rallies then the stock

market rallies and then the crypto

Market rallies the thing is that the

bond market hasn't rallied yet not only

that but a bond market rally typically

corresponds to a flight to safety

meaning that investors are selling

assets like stocks and crypto for US

Dollars and bonds as such you could say

that the best time to accumulate stocks

and cryptos is during bond market

rallies not Financial advice obviously

now the last two indicators the authors

look at in this section are volatility

and the take by sell ratio the tldr is

that btc's volatility indicators suggest

that it could Spike up or or down while

the take by sell ratio suggests that

retail investors are starting to rotate

out of BTC and into altcoins this is

another analysis that's been invalidated

by recent events Bitcoin dominance hit a

three-month High last week this is not

surprising given that Bitcoin dominance

tends to rise in the months leading up

to the Bitcoin Haring in retrospect the

take by sell ratio could have been

insiders taking profits on alts in the

second part of the report the authors

provide a General market update they

start by pointing out that consumer

confidence continues to be on a

long-term decline this is significant

because most economic growth in the US

is driven by consumption less

consumption means less economic growth

the authors also point out that the FED

intends on doing one more rate hike and

keeping rates High into 2024 if you

watched our video about the fed's last

press conference you'll know that

chairman Jerome Powell appears to be

very concerned about a recession this

could change the fed's interest rate

plans that said the authors then

highlight the fact that consumers

apparently do not plan on reducing their

consumption despite the declining

confidence they're also not planning on

buying houses anytime soon this makes

sense considering that mortgage rates

are at multi-decade highs what's

fascinating is that many people who

recently purchased homes have decided to

lock in their current mortgage rates

this presumably implies that they

believe interest rates will rise even

higher than they already are this is an

outcome that the authors also foresee

due to housing driven inflation if you

watched our video about the housing

market from last year however you'll

know that the thing that drives housing

prices is ultimately the demand for

short-term and long-term rents depending

on the location there could be a decline

in both which will inevitably result in

lower housing prices moreover housing

prices often fall the most during a

recession which could still be coming

not surprisingly one of the only

economic sectors that's continued to

Boom over the last few months has been

the defense sector this is due to the

unprecedented military support for

Ukraine and what's likely to be a

similar amount of military support for

Israel however the authors noticed an

uptick in orders for Goods in general

even when you strip out those related to

defense now this could be explained by

the fact that there was initially an

overs supply of goods because of

pandemic restrictions a return to

regularly scheduled manufacturing could

be the reason the authors predict that

high interest rates will eventually

bring manufacturing back down except for

defense related manufacturing if you

watched our video about the man who

predicted everything however you'll know

Manufacturing could continue to run hot

due to all the fiscal spending you know

it's telling that bitfinex is analyzing

all of this it seems that everyone is a

macro analyst these days in all

seriousness the authors also looked at

US GDP which was recently revised down

but remains strong at over 2% per year

the next GDP figure will be released on

the 26th of October if it comes in

higher than expected the FED May commit

to staying higher for longer and deliver

one more rate hike at its next meeting

what's bizarre is that the authors claim

that economic growth will come down as

high interest rates start to affect the

economy particularly the housing market

this seems to contradict their earlier

claim that the housing market will

continue to be a source of inflation

that housing prices will stay high based

on our admittedly amateur understanding

of the US housing market it's one of the

markets least likely to see a downturn

due to higher interest rates that's

simply because most us homeowners have

locked in a fixed interest rate for 30

years 70% to be exact another 10% have

locked in for 15 years specifics aside

the authors note that the combination of

declining inflation and strong economic

growth is increasing expectations of a

soft Landing AKA no recession because of

high interest rates if history is any

indication however it's not a question

of if but when we'll see a recession the

authors of this report seem to agree and

conclude with a sobering Insight quote

potential challenges in the year's

concluding months include the ongoing

United Auto Workers strike resumption of

student loan repayments heightened

energy costs and persistently High

interest rates you can add a potential

regional conflict in the Middle East to

that list more about that in the

description now in the final part of the

report the authors go over a few key

crypto headlines which you've probably

heard by now recall that this report was

published in the first week of October

even so the selection of headlines is

eye openening the first one is about

Tera co-founder do Quan for those

unfamiliar tether's former CTO and new

CEO Paulo Arduino who also happens to be

the CTO of bitfinex was critical of

tera's us stablecoin and referred to

tera's decision to back us with BTC as a

quote recipe for disaster now this

criticism was expected given that us was

a competitor to centralized stablecoins

like tether's usdt ironically though

tether has since revealed that its usdt

stable coin is partially backed by BTC

and is also committed to using a portion

of its monthly profits to buy BTC to

hold as additional reserves the fact

that a story about dquan is the first in

this bitfinex report is therefore

peculiar given these circumstances it's

a similar situation with the second

story in bitfinex's report which is

about a fraudulent crypto company called

Icom Tech which promised investors

abnormally High returns from crypto

trading and Mining as expected neither

of these Ventures existed and the money

was being spent elsewhere now two things

stand out about this story the first is

that Icom Tech was shut down way back in

2019 the only reason it was in the news

recently was because its founder finally

pleaded guilty the second is that tether

has launched multiple initiatives

related to Bitcoin mining over the last

year the mention of this story could

therefore be a consequence of tether's

interest in the Bitcoin mining industry

I'll remind you that tether is

bitfinex's sister company though the ex

exact relationship between them isn't

entirely clear never mind the fact that

they have overlapping employees like

poo anyway speculation aside the third

story in bitfinex's report is even more

peculiar it's about the sec's potential

approval of ethereum Futures ETFs which

subsequently launched just recently this

is peculiar because bitfinex and tether

appear to be focused on bitcoin not

ethereum to be fair they mention the

Bitcoin ETFs a lot still it's surprising

that they included this story from our

perspective it's possible that this has

to do with the asset managers involved

namely Valkyrie as reported by coindesk

valkyrie's largest client was and still

could be Tron founder Justin Sun News

flash most of the usdt in circulation

exists on Tron probably just a

coincidence now the the final Story the

bitfinex report unpacked might be the

most peculiar of the four that's because

it talks about how Taiwan is introducing

stricter crypto regulations this is a

reference to the decision to ban

unregistered crypto exchanges from

operating in the country which makes

sense the authors also cite another

headline about how the Taiwanese crypto

industry is effectively fighting back by

forming what is essentially a group that

will Lobby for crypto interests this

Lobby group presumably hopes to change

the regulations for unregistered

exchanges before they pass in November

now this is peculiar because te and

bitfinex are believed to be

headquartered in Hong Kong which is

technically part of China Tron itself

hails from China and in case you forgot

hosts most of the usdt in circulation

and as all of you will know the CCP

believes that Taiwan is part of China

China as well given these facts it's

possible that the author's choice to

select this story is related to the

allegiances of tether bitfinex and Tron

their largest crypto partner even if

this isn't the case it clearly pertains

to tether most crypto exchanges use

usdt cracking down on exchanges hurts

tether's bottom line so this brings us

to the big question and that's what all

of this means for the crypto Market well

for starters it underscores the fact

that indicators can and often do tell

you when volatility is about to strike

but the direction is almost always a

tossup in this case bitfinex forecasted

a pump and we saw a dump instead at the

same time it underscores the fact that

we seem to be entering a very volatile

period not just in crypto but also in

macro some of these factors are

relatively predictable like the fed's

rate hikes others are not so predictable

such as a war breaking out in the Middle

East it's these unpredictable factors

that make it impossible to know with

100% certainty where any Market is

headed next the crypto Market is no

exception and some would say that it's

even worse as a relatively new asset

class it's extremely volatile and the

ways of analyzing it are pretty new as

well the perfect example here is onchain

analysis which is as promising as it is

imperfect now the silver aligning to

this is that it seems to be sufficient

to get a sense of what's going on with

large cryptos such as BTC the fact that

the bitfinex report started at the

onchain level should be assigned to use

these indicators more often the fact of

the matter is that when there is less

BTC on exchanges then btc's price is

more volatile when you realize that the

balance of BTC on exchanges is in a

strong downtrend it begs the question of

how the Bitcoin Market will ever be

liquid enough for large institutional

investors to get involved as experienced

macro investor Ral pal pointed out in a

recent interview with my colleague

Jessica one of the main reasons why

institutions are sitting on the

sidelines in crypto is because of a lack

of liquidity the exit of large market

makers and the scrutiny of crypto

exchanges has increased that drain in

recent months in case you haven't

noticed the scrutiny of crypto exchanges

continues in most countries countes

notably the US the fact that the US

economy itself seems to be slowly but

surely sliding into Ray recession

suggests that there won't be many market

makers exchanges or investors running to

fill up crypto's liquidity pool speaking

of which it's possible that the macro

level volatility we're starting to

experience due to things like

geopolitics could cause the crypto

markets to puke in the not so distant

future the prospect of a double bottom

seems plaus aible given that we saw a

double top in the previous cycle a

capitulation among long-term Bitcoin

holders is also probably something that

black rock and Co would like to see or

even need to see before a spot Bitcoin

ETF is approved at the end of the day

that BTC needs to come from somewhere be

it the offshore exchanges or the

hardcore BTC hodlers chances are that

it's going to be a combination of both

and it's going to be interesting to see

where entities like bitfinex and tether

end up once the dust settles for all

their faults these companies have played

a key role in growing the crypto

industry to the size it is today whether

they will continue to play a key role

going forward remains to be seen if they

don't then that guarantees that a

shakeup of some kind will have to occur

and that will likely be bad for crypto

prices if they do then it's possible

that crypto won't check the regulatory

boxes it needs to keep growing but hey

who knows maybe there's a happy medium

out there somewhere let's just hope they

find

it and that's all for today's video
