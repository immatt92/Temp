week crypto Market rally BTC explodes a

speculation about an imminent spot

Bitcoin ETF approval hits an all-time

high decoupling crypto from stocks so

where is the crypto Market headed next

ethereum ecosystem updates a newly 2

Launches on ethereum while Unis swap

introduces trading fees and vitalic

voices his crypto related concerns why e

could be sending a warning sign not

another lawsuit the New York attorney

general files a complaint against Gemini

dcg its subsidiary and two of its

Executives what does this mean for

grayscales spot Bitcoin ETF

conversion missing house Speaker us Poli

politicians struggle to appoint a

colleague to one of congress's key

positions as investors look for clarity

around macro and crypto how stable coins

could get caught in the crossfire and a

closer look at last week's top

performing cryptos and where they could

be headed next all that in more in just

a

moment last week the crypto Market

experienced an epic rally with BTC

pumping by more than 10% as some of you

may have heard the initial pump was

caused by a report from coin Telegraph

that a spot Bitcoin ETF had been

approved this later turned out to be

false and the market fell back down

however just a few days later amended

applications by asset managers Fidelity

and black rock and a new spot Bitcoin

ETF application by grayscale took BTC

right back up to 30k Fed chairman Jerome

Pal's doish comments could perhaps also

have contributed to the rise though in

retrospect this seems unlikely that's

because the stock market crashed while

the crypto Market rallied if the cause

of the crypto rally had been a macro

Factor such as a Fed pause then the

stock market would have rallied too the

absence of this correlation suggests a

crypto specific factor and spot ETF

speculation was probably it a related

crypto specific factor that probably

played a role as well was comments by

Black Rock CEO Larry thinkink about

btc's initial pump on that false report

Larry said that btc's pump was a sign of

a flight to safety by investors implying

that BTC is analogous to other risk off

assets like gold and us treasuries this

begs the obvious question of where the

crypto Market is headed next well the

answer ultimately depends on the time

frame you're analyzing btc's daily chart

looks extremely bullish it painted a

bull flag last week and appears to be

painting another bull flag at the time

of shooting however things look a little

bit different when you zoom out to the

weekly as you can see it appears that

BTC is painting a head and shoulders

pattern this has been picked up by

technical analysts on crypto Twitter and

it's something that some of them have

been expecting for months there are also

striking parallels between BTC 2023

rally and the rally it experienced back

in

2021 it looks like a distribution

pattern followed by a dip and then a

head and shoulders pattern which took

BTC lower after being temporarily above

the Ballinger band moving average and

then being rejected now believe it or

not but this distribution pattern

followed by a dip and then a head and

shoulders is an actual technical

analysis pattern called a Three Peaks

and a doed house nope I'm not making

this up this incredibly Niche pattern

has historically happened around local

tops and cycle tops namely in the 1910s

1920s and 1970s if you just learned

something new Smash that like button by

the way now this suggests that the next

one to two weeks are going to be

critical for the crypto Market btc's

monthly chart suggests closing the month

above 27k would translate to a bounce

off the Ballinger band moving average

notice how being below this band means

bare market and being above it means

bull market notably the chart suggests

that if BTC closes the month above 27k

then it could rally up to around 45k in

the coming months conversely if it

breaks Below 27k in the next week or two

it could set the stage for a bare flag

that takes BTC back down to around 20K

which would likely be the local low for

BTC now the caveat is that such a big

drop in BTC would likely translate to

lower lows for most altcoins including

eth eth is in the process of breaking

down against BTC and could fall as low

as

0.035 BTC per eth if BTC Falls to 20K

then it would translate to an eth price

of less than $800 a lower low it's a

similar story if BTC was to Rally in fat

terms if eth continues to weaken against

BTC then a BTC price of around 45k would

translate to an eth price that's roughly

where it is now

$1,600 now of course the silver lining

in either scenario is that both would be

a good time to accumulate TS like eth if

you're already doing so by the way make

sure you're keeping your SS on a secure

wallet and minimizing your exchange fees

the coin Bureau deals page has the

biggest discounts on the former and up

to $40,000 of bonuses on the latter the

link will be down in the description I

digress now eth's weakness against BTC

is somewhat surprising given the

continued growth that the ethereum

ecosystem has experienced just last week

a new layer 2 called scroll confirmed

that it had deployed its main net

something that had been noticed by the

Crypt media and cross-chain Deens

earlier this month like the polygons ZK

evm scroll also uses ZK evm technology

which makes it possible to add smart

contract functionality to rollup based

scaling Solutions the difference is that

the polygon ZK evm technically has a

token Matic whereas scroll does not at

least not yet this presents a potential

opportunity if you watched our video

about coinbase's base you'll know that

using these layer twos is a great way to

set yourself up for a a potential

airdrop in the future although coinbase

initially denied there would be an

airdrop for base more recently The

Exchange has hinted that an airdrop

could occur at some point while scroll

has not yet confirmed whether it will be

issuing a token or not the fact that the

crypto project raised $80 million from

various crypto VCS suggests there is a

high likelihood that it will at some

point those VCS must make a return on

their investment at some point after all

on that note decentralized exchange Unis

swap recently made the controversial

decision to implement a 0.15% trading

fee on select trading pairs this is

controversial because the fees apply to

Unis swaps front end not the protocol

this means Unis swap Labs is capturing

this value and not uni token holders

it's also controversial because the

decision to implement the fee was not

voted on by uni token holders then again

the fact that Unis swaps front end is

centralized and controlled by Unis swap

Labs means they can technically do

whatever they want with it thankfully

there are other ways to access Unis swap

you'll know those other ways if you're

subscribed to our Weekly Newsletter if

you're not I suggest you do so ASAP the

link to that will also be in the

description now speaking of controversy

ethereum creator vitalic butterin has

come under Fire lately due to all the

eth he's been sending to exchanges

presumably to sell well vitalik recently

clarified that he hasn't sold eth for

personal gain since 2018 but well that

doesn't change the fact that he is

selling eth at the end of the day this

is bad optics for the untrained eye and

the recent headlines about vitalic

outlining the risks he sees for crypto

don't help either to be fair though his

concerns are Justified the risks are

related to crypto stagnating privacy and

permissionless crypto becoming a lost

cause as well as AI related

disruption given the circumstances it's

surprising that vitalic didn't list

regulation as one of the risks he's

concerned about this is likely because

ethereum is sufficiently decentralized

to not draw scrutiny from Regulators

like the SEC even so scrutiny of other

entities could do indirect damage to eth

digital currency group or dcg is one

such entity if you watched our recent

video about dcg you'll know this Crypt

Behemoth has been taking heat from all

sides ever since its subsidiary Genesis

trading shut its doors in November last

year the side sending out the most heat

has been Gemini now to refresh your

memory Gemini had a product called

Gemini earn which allowed users to earn

interest on their idle crypto behind the

scenes Gemini was giving this crypto to

Genesis to earn a yield a portion of

which would be paid to Gemini earn users

when Genesis went down this crypto was

lost Gemini's twin co-founders Cameron

and Tyler winlos have been raising hell

on social media ever since these words

turned to actions in July when Gemini

filed a lawsuit against dcg and its

co-founder and CEO Barry silbert this

was big given that dcg is one of the

largest companies in

cryptocurrency well The Regulators in

New York seemed to get the memo but the

response was unexpected New York's

attorney general sued all of the parties

involved Gemini dcg Barry silbert

Genesis and former Genesis CEO Michael

Morrow the Attorney General is alleging

that these parties defrauded investors a

spokesperson for dcg confirmed to

decrypt that New York Regulators had

been probing the company for months and

believe that they will be Vindicated in

court as you can imagine Gemini

applauded the lawsuit as Vindication

somewhat on their end but naturally took

issue with the fact that they were

lumped in with dcg and Co the bigger

issue is that if the New York attorney

general manages to convince the court

that these parties were at fault they

will be permanently banned from the

state of New York and would likely face

fines of over 1 billion

this is something that dcg likely can't

afford given its position that's because

the Genesis blowup left a massive hole

in dcg's balance sheet that it's just

barely managed to fill so far part of

this filling has come from grayscale's

Bitcoin trust whose management fees are

apparently the largest source of revenue

for the entire crypto conglomerate this

has led to speculation that grayscale

wasn't rushing to convert its Bitcoin

trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF our stance

was that the proof would be in the

pudding if grayscale wins its case

against the SEC and refiles to have its

Bitcoin trust converted into a spot

Bitcoin ETF then it was only speculation

well as it so happens grayscale did

recently win its case against the SEC

and the regulator missed the deadline to

appeal just a few days later grayscale

Julie refiled to have its Bitcoin trust

converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF but

the recent lawsuit against its parents

company has cast a shadow over its

approval prospects some analysts are

saying it gives sufficient justification

to the to Kick the Can down the road

whereas others are saying that it will

have no effect a few such as Bloomberg

ETF analyst James saart are in the

middle pointing out that it depends on

the relationship between Genesis and

gbtc without getting too deep into the

weeds Genesis was doing some

questionable stuff with gbtc with the

help of failed crypto hedge fund 3

arrows capital or 3ac the specifics of

these interactions as well as genesis's

role in the broader gbtc Market could

potentially jeopardize grayscale's new

ETF

application complicated I know and yet

the complexity of what's been going on

in the crypto industry pales in

comparison to the complexity of what's

been going on in the White House to

bring you up to speed the US government

almost went into shutdown back in

September because politicians couldn't

agree on a new budget after lots of back

and forth in the House of

Representatives a temporary budget was

approved by the house approved by the

Senate and signed by President Joe Biden

at the 11th Hour however all it did was

delay delay the government shutdown

until mid November Friday the 17th of

November to be exact passing a temporary

budget also simultaneously resulted in

Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy

being removed by his Republican

constituents now to our understanding

this removal happened because some

Republicans didn't like that Kevin had

compromised with Democrats in the house

to get a deal done if we're incorrect

though then do drop a comment down below

and let us all know you politics is not

our Forte regardless the consequence of

Kevin's removal is that there is no

speaker of the house to our

understanding this means that it's

practically impossible to bring bills to

a vote this is unfortunate given that

the substitute speaker is Patrick

McKenry an openly Pro crypto politician

if you watched our video over the

weekend about the cfpb's crypto

Crackdown you'll know that crypto

regulations must be passed ASAP P to

prevent this Crackdown from occurring

the absence of a speaker of the house

means that this won't happen soon which

increases the risk of enforcement in the

interim and it's not just crypto either

as the house struggles to find a speaker

major macro factors are showing their

faces such as the conflict in the Middle

East consider that we still have a

conflict in Eastern Europe and a

potential conflict emerging in East Asia

as well you know which ones I'm talking

about this uncomfortable reality has

riled up some politicians to the point

that they don't even care who the

speaker is anymore they just need to get

someone in ASAP to address these issues

before they spiral out of control others

have outright refused to throw their

support behind anyone for reasons we

honestly don't really understand the

craziest part about all of this is that

the absence of a house Speaker could

paradoxically be good for crypto that's

because as soon as Congress gets its

Affairs in order it's almost certain

that its first order of business will be

to pass the military spending bill which

is only waiting on house approval if

you've been keeping up with the crypto

headlines you'll know that this military

spending Bill contains a provision which

could force us-based stablecoin issuers

like Circle to collect kyc on all crypto

wallets holding

usdc this provision would come into

Force within 120 days of the bill

becoming law when you combine this with

increased pressure to probe crypto's use

in certain types of illicit activity

what you get is a very high likelihood

of additional restrictions on crypto

being introduced in the US and elsewhere

the Black Swan would be the spot Bitcoin

ETF applications being denied for these

reasons but let's not get ahead of

ourselves on the fud and consider the

flip side no matter what Congress

decides to do chances are that it will

involve printing money in the absence of

any regulatory surprises crypto should

pump in response in fact it's possible

that it's already pumping in

anticipation of all of this and that

brings us neatly to last week's top

performing cryptos so Jessica welcome

back and take it

away thanks Guy well last week's top

performing cryptos were bit coin SV

salana chain link Aptos and stacks

starting with Bitcoin SV it's bsv coin

appears to have pumped in response to a

series of tweets put out by the Satoshi

Nakamoto Twitter account which is

believed to be controlled by Craig

Wright the creator of bsv bsv forks also

appear to have gotten a boost from the

spot Bitcoin ETF application update now

as impressive as bv's recent pump has

been it barely registers on its

long-term price chart

that said we have noticed that bsv tends

to pump aggressively in the months

leading up to the Bitcoin haling as such

it is possible that bsv will continue to

pump until early next year so we'll have

to see about that one next up we have

salana whose so coin appears to have

pumped in response to the news that the

crypto project has become an ecosystem

partner of one of the free zones here in

Dubai the recent completion of sana's

hyperdrive hacker on could also have

contributed to the pump as you can see

Saul experienced a massive pump last

week that could lead to a bab band

breakout to the upside the catch is that

a $30 is a really strong resistance for

soul it's going to take a big Catalyst

for it to break above that level in

absence of such a catalyst we could see

a rejection when it comes to chain link

its link token appears to have pumped

due to the announcement that link

staking V2 is coming

chain link did not specify when V2 will

be released but the project noted on X

the audit is currently underway note

that these audits can take a few months

to complete in any case link is looking

similar to S on the weekly chart it's on

the brink of breaking out to the upside

on the Ballinger bands but faces extreme

resistance around the $10 level as with

s it's going to take a big Catalyst for

link to break that barrier V2 staking

could do the trick if it comes soon as

for Aptos its AP coin appears to have

pumped in response to its oneyear

aniversary the project claims that the

onchain activity related to the

Milestone is what caused its blockchain

to experience a temporary outage a

little bit ironic considering that Aptos

has been branded as Solana killer now in

contrast to S apt is still below the

Ballinger band moving average on the

weekly and it seems to have been

rejected by by it during the recent

rally this foreshadows a red week for

apt which is expected given its massive

rally remember that Corrections are part

and parcel of the crypto market last but

not least we have Stax whose STX coin

appears to have pumped due to a

combination of the hype around the spot

Bitcoin ETF application updates and the

stacks hackathon in London over the

weekend had I had known sooner I could

have attended given that I was also in

the UK maybe next time so funly enough

stx's price chart looks like a much more

volatile version of btc's its weekly

chart is on the brink of squeezing to

the upside or the downside this likely

depends on where BTC is headed you'll

recall that guy already covered that

earlier if not go back and watch that

ASAP and if you want to keep track of
