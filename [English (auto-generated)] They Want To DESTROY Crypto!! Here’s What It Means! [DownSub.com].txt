there's been a coordinated Crackdown on

crypto in the United States since the

start of the Year while many entities

have been involved in this Crackdown one

entity in particular has been front and

center and it's believed to be one of

the key players in operation chokepoint

2 there's no shortage of evidence to

suggest this and the latest piece of

said evidence is an upcoming proposal to

apply ebanking laws to the crypto

industry as you might have guessed this

this would not be good that's why today

we're going to tell you everything you

need to know about this entity unpack

what its director recently said about

crypto and explain what it could all

mean for the markets my name is guy

you're watching the coin Bureau don't go

anywhere the Consumer Finance Protection

Bureau or cfpb is an independent agency

of the US government now I'm using air

quotes because independent seems to be

codee for little to no government

oversight this is surprising considering

that the cfpb Apparently has the power

to implement and enforce Financial laws

similarly to the SEC the cfpb's purpose

is to quote ensure that markets for

Consumer Financial products are fair

transparent and competitive in contrast

to the SEC the cfpb has only been around

since 201 10 and seldom engages in rulle

making and enforcement at least compared

with the SEC if you watched our video

about The Man Behind the crypto

Crackdown you'll know that the cfpb was

created as part of the Dodd Frank act

that was passed after the 2008 financial

crisis you'll also know that the cfbb

was proposed by Elizabeth Warren the

most anti- crypto politician in

Washington DC you'll even know that the

cfpb gets its funding from from the

Federal Reserve and makes up as much as

12% of the fed's entire budget Jerome

pal himself was asked about the fed's

funding of the cfpb back in March and

admitted he couldn't provide any

specifics because the FED has no

oversight of its operations on that note

if you watch that video you'll know that

the man behind the crypto Crackdown is

none other than Michael bar the fed's

vice chair for supervision you'll also

know that he was one of the architects

of the Dodd Frank act and that it also

created the position at the FED which he

now holds big think now what's crazy is

that something similar seems to have

happened with the cfpb as I just

mentioned Elizabeth Warren was the one

who proposed the cfpb but she wasn't the

one who put it together that was Rohit

choa Elizabeth's Ally he created the

agency in 2010 and became its director

in 2021 prior to becoming director of

the cfpb Rohit was a commissioner at the

Federal Trade Commission or FTC where he

spent most of his time scrutinizing big

Tech over its data practices not

surprisingly the first thing Rohit did

as director of the cfpb was scrutinize

big Tech again this time for its Payment

Systems what's interesting is that Rohit

doesn't appear to be inherently anti-

crypto per se rather he appears to be

Pro bank which means he's against any

Innovation that would disrupt the

traditional banking system note that

this seems to be the case with Elizabeth

and with SEC chairman Gary gendler as

well I think we can all guess who's

bankrolling them and if you like that

pun smash the like button anyway

speculation aside the cfpb has only made

the crypto headlines a few times since

Rohit became its director these are

articles have gone by mostly unnoticed

which is a bit scary considering their

contents back in October 2021 Pro crypto

Senator Bill haggy warned Rohit not to

go Rambo on crypto for context the cfpb

has been warning about crypto since

2014 when President Biden signed that

executive order about crypto last March

it essentially invited the cfpb to

scrutinize crypto along with the other

Regulators now coin desk initially

speculated that the cfpb would be at

odds with the SEC when it came to crypto

but it's clear that they are in fact on

the same page then last August Kathy

cringer the former director of the cfpb

warned the crypto industry to be careful

about what they wish for when it comes

to crypto regulations that's because the

result could be that Regulators will

apply trfy rules to crypto which would

effectively kill the real crypto

industry note that this is something

we've been warning about in our videos

about crypto regulations well Cathy's

prediction turned out to be correct last

December crypto platform nexo revealed

that a big part of why it decided to

exit the US market was because of

pressure from the cfpb it's safe to

assume that the cfbb has played a role

in pressuring other crypto companies to

the point that they left the us as well

as for the cfpb's recent proposal to

apply ebanking laws to crypto that we

mentioned in the introduction it came

from a passing comment that roit made

during a recent event some crypto media

Outlets picked up on this passing

comment but like all the others it seems

to have gone by largely unnoticed not

only that but the broader context of

rohit's comment seems to have been

completely missed now when we watched

his speech and the subsequent question

period at that event it made all all the

other videos we've done about crypto

regulations seem like puzzle pieces that

had suddenly come together the result

was a clear picture of the roles all

these different anti- crypto Regulators

are playing and when they're supposed to

play them I can tell you right now that

the cfpb's sudden focus on crypto seems

to be a consequence of the fact that the

SEC is being humiliated in court in its

crypto related cases as most of you will

know the judge in the sec's case against

Ripple ruled that xrp and its secondary

sales were not Securities more recently

the judge in grayscale's case against

the SEC ruled that the regulator had not

provided sufficient justification for

denying grayscale's Bitcoin trust to

spot ETF conversion the result is that

the cfpb has been called in as backup

and it may be more effective than we

think

now rohit's recent comments about

applying ebanking laws to crypto were

made during an event about digital

payments at the Brookings institution

note that the Brookings institution is a

very influential Think Tank based in

Washington DC that has hosted many of

the most powerful people in the world in

this case the event featured multiple

high-profile speakers including fed

Governor Chris Waller I won't go into

what they said for the sake of time but

I will point out that there were a few

familiar faces from the pro crypto side

namely yesha yadav a professor at

Vanderbilt University who's testified

before as for Rohit though he started

his speech by talking about the Monopoly

on payments that WeChat and alipe have

in China and how the US needs to avoid

this same outcome with its own big tech

companies he recounted how Facebook's

Libra digital currency failed but how

big Tech is still working on similar

Technologies Rohit went on to underscore

the fact that non-bank entities are not

subject to the same rules as Banks and

this could be dangerous for consumers he

then said that consumers need to be

protected from quote private currencies

which presumably includes crypto since

Regulators consider it to be private to

ensure consumers are protected from

these evil private currencies Rohit said

that the cfpb will do five things first

it will request extensive data from Big

Tech and fintech about their payment

systems to understand exactly where the

dangers are particularly around data and

digital currency issuance second quote

to reduce the harms of Errors hacks and

unauthorized transfers the cfpb will

explore the applicability of the

electronic fund transfer act with

respect to private digital dollars and

other virtual currency CES for Consumer

and Retail use now logically this means

stable coins and cryptos in general

naturally the electronic fund transfer

Act is supposed to protect consumers

when making digital payments of any kind

the act includes a long list of

Provisions including protecting against

fraud refunding defrauded users

resolving transaction disputes and

Reporting directly to the cfpb if you're

wondering why the this is such a problem

for stable coins and crypto consider

that it's technically impossible to do

things like reverse transactions at the

blockchain level put simply the parts of

the crypto ecosystem that are truly

crypto would not be able to comply and

would likely be banned news flash that's

the entire purpose of expanding this

rule we will know if and when it will go

into effect when the cfpb publishes its

regulatory agenda for the winter of 2023

sometime in early December so mark your

calendars and you'll never guess who is

in the

car hello and welcome back to GM crypto

now we have so much fun and exciting

stuff coming up for you on today's show

but first we need to talk about the coin

bu deals page guy that's right Jessica

because it really is the place to find

the very best deals in crypto for

starters you can find bonuses of up to

$40,000 at some of the best crypto

exchanges and that's not all Jessica

because you can also get discounts on

Hardware wallets sign up bonuses for

some of the top exchanges and trading

fee discounts of up to

60% amazing guy where can people find

this deals page well just head on over

to coin.com

deals or use the link in the

description now the third thing that the

cfpb will do to ensure that consumers

are protected from private currencies is

to investigate non-banks which likely

includes crypto platforms Rohit

highlighted that the cfpb can grant

itself the power to supervise these

entities especially if they work with

big Banks fourth the cfpb will recommend

that the financial stability oversight

Council or fso exercise its power to

deem certain non-bank entities as

systemically important this would

automatically give Regulators like the

SEC jurisdiction over crypto exchanges

and that's just the tip of the iceberg

if you watched our video about Bank

bailin you'll know that systemically

important Banks can use customers

deposits to bail themselves out the next

time there's a banking crisis you'll

also know that members of the FDIC

explicitly contemplated expanding this

definition to crypto exchanges besides

the fact that this could mean that any

coins tokens or cash you have on a

crypto exchange could be used to bail it

out designating a crypto exchange as

systemically important means that it

could be legally acquired by a mega Bank

like JP Morgan if it goes down note that

Rohit is also part of the FDIC speaking

of whom Rohit didn't actually say that

crypto exchanges should be designated as

systemically important rather he he said

that stable coin issuers should be

designated as systemically important

this would make them subject to what I

just told you potential bailin and

potential Mega Bank

Acquisitions now the last thing that the

cfpb will do to ensure that consumers

are protected from private currencies is

to expand laws related to data use in

finance Rohit concluded by saying that

this is because he doesn't want the US

payment system to consolidate like it

did in China and wants to protect

Financial Freedom this is pretty

hypocritical considering that Rohit has

been an advocate of fed now since his

FTC days for reference fed now appears

to be the first step towards a central

bank digital currency or cbdc if you've

watched any of our videos about cbdcs

you'll know that they result in total

Financial control from our perspective

then Rohit doesn't truly care about

Financial Freedom he just hates the

private sector now I can't stress enough

how passive rohit's comments about

crypto were the second and last bullet

points about how the cfpb plans on

protecting consumers were basically the

only times he mentioned crypto in his

speech thankfully though he elaborated

on his comments in the question period

first Rohit explained that he doesn't

want the US Financial system to be a

private sector Monopoly like China's but

that he doesn't want it to be a public

sector Monopoly like in Europe instead

he wants the public sector to provide

the core payments infrastructure while

the private sector makes the Innovation

believe it or not but the interviewer

asked Rohit if it's better to have a

Chinese style system considering how

advanced it is Rohit said no because

even he knows that public and private

don't exist in China it's all the CCP

unfortunately Rohit can't see that he's

been advocating for something much worse

and if that wasn't insane enough the

interviewer then asked Rohit if the

treasury Department could issue a cbdc

in lie of the FED Rohit started by

saying that it's complicated but under

pressure he admitted that this is

theoretically possible the treasury

could issue a cbdc let's remember that

one shall we now Rohit also answered a

few questions from the audience and one

of them was about the fso designating

stablecoin issuers and other such

entities as systemically important Rohit

was asked whether the fso was on board

with this since it was a pretty bold

declaration to make roit smiled and

explained that the dodf Frank act gave

the fso the power to designate Financial

entities as systemically important for

financial stability reasons he then

reminded everyone that us Regulators had

already announced that they would step

in with enforcement actions in the

absence of Regulation we immediately

realized that this was a reference to a

report published by the president's

working group on financial markets or

pwg way back in 2021 we summarize that

report and if you watch that video you

might remember that the pwg said the

fsock will crack down in the absence of

Regulation here's the direct quote in

the absence of of congressional action

which is urgently needed to address the

credential risks inherent in payment

stable coins the agency's recommend that

the financial stability oversight

Council consid steps available to it to

address the risks outlined in this

report now for those unfamiliar the fso

and the pwg consist of the same

Regulatory Agencies fso is just bigger

they're both led by the Secretary of the

Treasury

this suggests that Janet yelen is

another key player in the regulation by

enforcement that we've seen then again

most of the other Regulators are anti-

crypto too for the fso you have the

treasury secretary who is anti crypto

the FED chairman who is anti- crypto the

controller of the currency who is anti-

crypto the director of the cfpb who is

anti- crypto the chair of the SEC who is

next level anti- crypto the chairman of

the FDIC who is anti- crypto I think you

get the point and the only thing these

Regulators hate more than crypto is

stable coins that's simply because

stable coins are direct competitors to

cbdcs and therefore threaten their

control of the financial system now when

the interviewer asked Rohit if it was

ironic that a bank collapse caused

Circle usdc to deeg he just scoffed

Rohit said that there have been many

cases of stable coins dep pegging under

completely different

circumstances this inspired the

interviewer to ask RIT how the hell

tether is still standing Rohit seemed to

dodge the question which is fascinating

considering tether's peculiar political

connections you can learn more about

those using the link in the description

anyway I digress this brings me to the

big question and that's what all of this

means for the crypto Market the answer

ultimately depends on whether Congress

can pass reasonable crypto regulations

before The Regulators themselves go

Rogue as it so happens a stablecoin bill

is currently in play but it's not moving

very quickly the clarity for payment

stable coins bill was passed by the

house Financial Services committee back

in July but has yet to be voted on by

the house at the time of shooting this

video this is partially because other

things have kept them preoccupied and

partially because the house currently

doesn't have a speaker based on our

understanding the house doesn't actually

need to have a speaker for bills to be

passed but it makes things a lot more

complicated without one and funnily

enough the speaker prot temporary The

Substitute speaker so to speak is

currently Patrick McKenry the pro crypto

politician who tabled the bill this has

led to hopes that the house will manage

to approve the stable coin Bill even

without without a permanent speaker but

even if that happens the bill will have

two more Hoops to then jump through

these are the Senate where the Democrats

have a majority and President Biden who

is himself a Democrat now if you've

watched any of our summaries of

congressional crypto hearings you'll

know that Democrats appear to be largely

anti-crypto whereas Republicans appear

to be largely Pro crypto although it's

true that there are pro crypto voices on

the Democrat side as well there don't

seem to be enough of them to get the

bill passed meanwhile anti- crypto bills

such as Elizabeth Warren's digital asset

anti-money laundering Act of 2023 have

started to gain traction due to the

reports that crypto is being used to

fund certain militant groups of course

Elizabeth has been working closely with

all the anti-crypto Regulators too given

these and other circumstances like Wars

for example it seems unlikely that a

stable coin bill will be approved before

these anti- crypto Regulators act

realistically it won't be until after

the next election that any crypto bills

are approved and this assumes a

republican majority in the House and

Senate what this means is that there's a

real risk that we'll see a stable coin

Crackdown in the US in the coming months

and if you watched our video about the

fed's warning to Banks you'll know that

they're already Gathering the info they

need finding out which banks are working

with which stablecoin issuers now the

Silver Lining is that not all stable

coin issuers are based in the United

States tether being the obvious example

the fact that its usdt stable coin is

used for almost all crypto trading means

that a stable coin cracked down by

anti-crypto Regulators in the US may not

affect the crypto Market all that much

from what we've seen us-based stable

coins such as as cires usdc are used

primarily in defi in circle case its

close affiliation to large trefi

institutions like Black Rock could

protect it from the worst of what's

potentially coming the caveat is that

equally large trafi institutions clearly

want stable coins gone so then this begs

the question of which of the two has

more influence when it comes to crypto

regulations asset managers like Black

Rock or Mega Banks like JP

Morgan well we'll find out in the coming

months when we either see a spot Bitcoin

ETF approved or us-based stable coins

put out of business let's just hope that

being focused on stable coins Keeps The

Regulators away from actual crypto

projects and that's all for today's
