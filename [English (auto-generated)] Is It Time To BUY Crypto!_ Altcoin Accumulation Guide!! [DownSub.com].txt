investing in altcoins can make you a lot

of money but only if you know when to

buy and when to sell given that crypto

is currently in a bare Market the

question you should be asking now is

obviously when to buy when is the right

time to accumulate those next 100x coins

and tokens before the Bull Run begins

today we're going to take you through a

few metrics which suggest that the time

for accumulation could be imminent and

give you a sense of just how big the

gains could be during the next bull

market my name is guy and you are

watching the coin

Bureau I'll start by saying that I am

not a financial adviser and nothing in

this video is financial advice in case

the T-shirt didn't give it away already

it's purely educational content that's

meant to help you on your crypto Quest

that said knowing when to accumulate

altcoins ultimately comes down to where

we are in the crypto Market cycle as

most of you will know crypto follows a

4-year cycle that's believed to be

driven by the Bitcoin harving which

happens every four years if you know

this prove it by Smashing that like

button now the last Bitcoin harving

happened in May 2020 and in the year and

a half that followed BTC went up by

around 7x eth went up by more than 20x

and hundreds of altcoins like adaah went

up by 100x or more in case you didn't

know the next Bitcoin harving will

happen in April next year before you run

off and start filling up your altcoin

bags though there are four things you

need to keep in mind the first is that

not every crypto cycle is so clear-cut

some Cycles have been slightly longer

and others have been slightly shorter as

you may have heard the current crypto be

Market has been abnormally long now the

reason for this is different depending

on who you ask but in our opinion it's

primarily because of crypto's

correlation to macro factors in other

words it's because bigger investors are

more involved in crypto and this is

making its price action mirror that of

other large asset classes namely tech

stocks if this is indeed the case then

the Crypt Market could continue if tech

stocks see another leg lower this is

certainly possible given the other macro

factors in play such as interest rates

and geopolitical tensions the caveat is

that crypto hasn't been nearly as

correlated to tech stocks in recent

months logically this means that

crypto's price action has been driven

primarily by crypto specific factors

during this period the facts that BTC

barely moved on a higher than expected

CPI print but pumped by 10% on the

rumors of a spot Bitcoin ETF listing is

clear evidence of this the problem is

that there are lots of bearish crypto

factors that could likewise keep prices

suppressed for the foreseeable future

most of these have to do with

regulations which have made bigger

investors uncomfortable investing in

crypto this would explain the recent

lack of crypto and macro correlation if

you've watched any of our videos about

crypto regulations you'll know that most

of crypto's regulatory issues won't be

solved anytime soon while it's possible

that we could still see a bullish

Catalyst like a spot Bitcoin ETF listing

this is unlikely to happen until the

regulatory issues are resolved even then

it's possible that the spot Bitcoin ETF

listing could be a Selden news event

given the current lack of interest in

crypto as the recently approved ethereum

Futures ETF has shown an ETF listing

doesn't guarantee investor inflows it

just sets the stage for a massive bull

market which will eventually come and

folks here is a pro tip make sure you

have accounts on multiple crypto

exchanges to ensure that you can always

cash in or cash out the coin Bureau

deals page has bonuses of up to $440,000

and trading fee discounts of up to 60%

on the best cryptocurrency exchanges the

link will be in the

description now this ties into the

second thing you need to keep in mind

before you accumulate altcoins and

that's Bitcoin and its relationship to

alts although crypto as an asset class

is considered to be risky within crypto

BTC is seen as the safe haven asset it's

where the money moves when the market is

crashing there are also bullish reasons

for money moving into BTC though as you

might have guessed one of these is the

Bitcoin harving which I'll remind you is

coming sometime in April next year here

between now and then investor interest

in BTC will likely continue to increase

and some would say that is guaranteed

given that the final deadline for the

SEC to decide about black Rock's spot

Bitcoin ETF application will be just

before the Bitcoin harving naturally

what this means is that investor

interest in altcoins will likely

continue to decrease between now and the

Bitcoin harving in Practical terms this

means that altcoin prices could continue

to fall and some could still Fall by 50%

or more if we see another leg lower in

the crypto Market once the Bitcoin

harving has happened though history

suggests that BTC will start to pump

eventually this money will flow into

altcoins as investors become more

comfortable taking bigger risks in an

already risky asset class what's

interesting is that this rotation into

altcoins seems to require a catalyst now

if you were around in crypto in 2020 you

might recall that the Catalyst that

caused money to flow out of BTC and into

altcoins was decentralized Finance or

defi the defi Niche took off after its

protocols started issuing tokens that

were seeing mind melting gains and

impossible interest rates for staking in

retrospect defi summer was the first

domino in the altcoin bull market and it

resulted eventually in astronomical

gains for so-called ethereum Killers

like salana ironically enough the defi

tokens themselves lagged after the

original defi hype was over and never

recovered to their previous highs

assuming history repeats then the next

altcoin bull market will begin with a

crypto Niche blowing up in a good way

now if you watched our video about the

crypto niches to watch for the next Bull

Run you'll know we're bullish on

so-called Salam Killers defi protocols

and decentralized social media among

others I'll explain why in just a second

now there are many ways to assess where

we are in the Bitcoin altcoin cycle the

easiest way is to look at Bitcoin

dominance the measure of how much of

crypto's total market cap is just

BTC as you can see Bitcoin dominance has

been rising since last September and

could rise as high as 56% % now another

way to assess where we are in the

Bitcoin altcoin cycle is to look at the

eth BTC pair eth's value measured in BTC

you could say that eth is the safe haven

among altcoins and therefore serves as a

simple proxy for how altcoins are doing

as you can see it's not looking too good

if our measurements are correct eth

could lose as much as 30% of its value

against BTC in the coming months the

fact that our friend Benjamin Cowen sees

the same thing suggests that our

measurements aren't too far off this

could foreshadow a major ShakeOut among

altcoins at least in BTC terms now this

relates to the third thing you need to

keep in mind before you accumulate

altcoins and that's that they're not all

going to pump or dump at the same time

after the spotlight turns away from BTC

it will probably shine on eth given that

it's the second largest crypto after

that it's anyone's guess now as I

mentioned earlier chances are that the

first altcoins to pump will come from a

specific crypto Niche like for instance

gamey or nfts make no mistake when the

altcoins in this Niche do pump you will

feel the fomo the initial inflows will

be enormous relative to market cap

resulting in unprecedented gains for

some folks this is when you'll need to

to remember what happened to the define

niche the pump may be

shortlived instead of foming into the

latest VC narrative and getting wrecked

ask yourself this what are the most

speculative crypto niches of all and

which ones have the best fundamentals

the reason you want to ask both

questions is because of the underlying

macro factors that will be guiding the

decisions of the biggest investors news

flash but the biggest investors are the

ones that will pump altcoins by 100x or

more not regular retail Apes like you

and me from our perspective the main

macro factor that the biggest investors

will be watching is interest rates if

interest rates are low then the big

investors will probably bet their money

on the most speculative cryptos if

interest rates are High they'll probably

bet on the ones with the best

fundamentals now Once Upon a Time the

most speculative cryptos were those that

claimed to be the next Bitcoin during

the last cycle the most speculative

cryptos were those that claimed to be

the next ethereum it's no Co instance

that ethereum Killers like Avalanche saw

some of the largest returns in

percentage terms so this begs the

question of what the most speculative

cryptos will be during the next cycle we

can't say for sure but we suspect the

answer will be those so-called salana

Killers such as for instance Aptos now I

must stress that this is just our

opinion and we might not be correct so

it's on you to figure out which crypto

Niche you think is the most speculative

now when it comes to the cryptos with

the best fundamentals fees and

tokenomics are the name of the game

according to the crypto fees website the

cryptos which have generated the most

fees over the last week are ethereum and

Bitcoin followed by a bunch of defi

protocols and select layer ones this is

where tokenomics come in one of the

advantages that ethereum has over

Bitcoin is that a portion of all eth

used to pay for fees is burned as we've

seen this can make eth deflationary at

times which has the Practical effect of

increasing its Price Less Supply Plus

same or more demand equals Price's rise

the catch is that ethereum has a very

large market cap meaning that the fees

and and deflationary tokenomics aren't

that significant relative to eth's size

this doesn't mean that eth won't pump it

just means that it will pump much less

compared to a similar crypto with a much

smaller market cap defi Protocols are a

perfect example and that's why we're

bullish on them defi protocols generate

much more in fees relative to their

market cap the only thing missing is the

tokenomics a way of translating those

fees into gains so far only a few

protocols such as make a DA have done

this lo and behold it's worked damn well

for mkr's Price despite the crypto be

Market imagine what that chart would

look like during a bull market for more

profitable dii protocols like arve and

uniswap note that regulatory Clarity is

required for this to happen hence the

earlier comments about regulations the

this pertains to the fourth thing you

need to keep in mind before accumulating

altcoins and that's how the next wave of

crypto investors will approach the

market it's safe to assume that the next

wave of big investors will stick to the

largest cryptos because of their

liquidity and Market depth now in theory

this means that the largest cryptos will

pump the most but if you think this then

you've already forgotten what I just

said in practice it's the market cap

that matters the larger the market cap

the harder it is to push prices up or

down that means smaller gains and losses

in percentage terms this is something

that the next wave of small investors

probably won't understand the previous

cycle suggests they'll be aggressively

accumulating cryptos with a low price

tag regardless of the market cap because

they think they'll be billionaires if

the price tag becomes as large as btc's

or eths now not not sure who needs to

hear it but Sheba enu will never reach

$1 because then it would have a market

cap of $590 trillion which is literally

larger than any Financial thing in

existence except maybe derivatives debt

which could be in the

quadrillions in any case the result of

this retail investor reality is that the

market cap of some cryptos could rise to

unreasonable levels just like Sheba enu

and the other mem coins did in the last

cycle as such you must take both the

market cap and the sticker price of an

altcoin into account before you

accumulate the only thing more important

than market cap and sticker price is

marketing and the most important part of

marketing is the narrative there's no

shortage of narratives in crypto and

they often coincide with the different

crypto niches it's too soon to say which

narratives will be the dominant ones

believe it or not but we believe that

one of the biggest crypto narratives

during the next Bull Run could be

privacy that's simply because big

investors like central banks and Wealthy

individuals don't want their balances to

be publicly viewable to the plebs this

will require some kind of privacy

solution of course privacy coins are a

niche of their own but privacy can

theoretically be applied to almost any

crypto project including Bitcoin and

ethereum consider a scenario where

salana killers are the killer Niche and

one of them introduces privacy features

that would be a moonshot in this context

I should note though that narratives

don't need to be this elaborate and it's

more likely than not that they won't be

look no further than the metaverse

narrative for evidence of that when

Facebook announced that it was

rebranding to meta every crypto that did

anything related to the metaverse saw

ridiculous gains more recently air

related cryptos rallied due to the hype

around chat GPT if you look at the ones

that pumped the most you'll notice that

they had a low sticker price a small

market cap and fit the narrative they

were also available on the best

exchanges so remember our deals page

with all those bonuses in the

description in some then don't ask

yourself which altcoins you want to

accumulate ask yourself which altcoins

new investors will want to accumulate

when the crypto bull market begins again

it's too soon to say for sure but with a

bit of research you should come up with

a list of viable cryptos to consider

right then you're probably wondering by

now just how big the gains could be

during the next crypto bull market well

the answer ultimately depends on which

crypto we're talking about by now you'll

know that the money will flow from BTC

to eth to the large caps and to others

so let's take it from the top obviously

there are many ways of measuring

historical gains the way we like to do

it is to look at the previous zone of

support and resistance for the entire

cycle and compare it to the most recent

top in btc's case this Zone was around

1K during the first cycle btc's top in

2017 was around 20K so 20 X in the

second cycle btc's key Zone was around

10K btc's top in 2021 was 70k so 7x this

suggests that BTC has diminishing

returns over time which makes sense

considering that this is what happens to

every asset as it matures if we accept

this premise then BTC should see around

a 3X gain between its current key Zone

and its next top as far as we can tell

btc's key zone is around 40K for this

cycle this actually makes sense

considering that 40K is roughly what it

will cost to mine BTC after the next

Haring so some quick maths tells you

that this translates to a BTC price of

roughly 120k which is in line with many

other predictions granted that there's

no shortage of those anyway next up we

have eth which is also seeing

diminishing returns and seems to be

following BTC just just one cycle behind

eth's zone of support during the

previous cycle was around $250 and its

top in 2021 was around 5K that's a 20x

gain and it foreshadows a 7x gain

compared to its current Zone similarly

to BTC eth's zone for this cycle is

around 2.5k roughly 10x the zone of the

previous cycle funnily enough a 7x gain

would translate to a 15K eth top which

is also what many are predicting what's

fascinating is that the other large caps

seem to be one cycle behind eth namely

the so-called ethereum Killers I'll use

cardano's adaah as an example here adaah

saw a 100x gain between its Zone in the

previous cycle and its top in the most

recent cycle from 3 cents to $3 adah's

zone for the current cycle seems to be

around

$120 so if cardano is following ethereum

this means adaah could see a 20x gain

between this key Zone and its next top

of around

$24 that doesn't sound like much but

consider that ader is currently worth

25 that's almost 100x now I know all

this sounds amazing but I must

underscore the fact that these are just

a few of many predictions out there the

fact of the matter is that nobody knows

how high these cryptos could go and it

depends on factors that are

fundamentally outside of our control be

they crypto or macro the only certainty

is that crypto is extremely speculative

even when you sprinkle in some

fundamentals this of course makes crypto

very volatile which makes some people

Millionaires and other people poor you

obviously want to become the former but

you also want to make sure that you

don't become the latter in the process

so never invest more than you can afford

to lose and always remember to store

your crypto on your own personal wallet

so it doesn't get lost when the next

centralized entity goes down as it so

the biggest discounts on the best
